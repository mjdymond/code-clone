# ResumeOptimizer MVP Architecture

## System Overview

The ResumeOptimizer MVP will be built as a modern web application with a React/TypeScript frontend and a Supabase backend. The architecture focuses on creating a scalable, maintainable system that supports the core resume optimization functionality while establishing a foundation for future enhancements.

## Backend Architecture

### Database Design (Supabase)

**Core Tables:**
- `users` - User account information
- `resumes` - Resume documents uploaded by users
- `jobs` - Job descriptions scraped from URLs
- `analyses` - Results from comparing resumes to job descriptions
- `rewrites` - AI-generated resume optimizations 

### API Services

1. **Authentication Service**
   - User registration, login, and session management via Supabase Auth

2. **Document Management Service**
   - Resume upload, parsing, and storage
   - Format conversion (PDF/DOCX to structured data)
   - Resume versioning and retrieval

3. **Job Scraping Service**
   - URL parsing and content extraction
   - Job detail structuring (responsibilities, qualifications)
   - Company information aggregation

4. **Analysis Engine**
   - Resume-to-job comparison algorithms
   - Keyword matching and gap identification
   - Match scoring and recommendation generation

5. **Resume Optimization Service**
   - AI-powered resume rewriting
   - Section-by-section enhancement suggestions
   - Before/after comparison generation

6. **Job Search Service**
   - Web search integration for job discovery
   - Results filtering and ranking
   - Saved search management

## Frontend Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Resume Editor**
   - Rich text editing environment
   - Format preservation from original documents
   - Real-time saving and version control

2. **Job Description Viewer**
   - Structured display of job details
   - Highlighted key requirements and qualifications
   - Company context information

3. **Analysis Dashboard**
   - Visual representation of resume-job match
   - Keyword highlighting and gap identification
   - Actionable improvement recommendations

4. **Optimization Workspace**
   - Side-by-side comparison of original and optimized resume
   - Section-by-section editing with AI suggestions
   - Version comparison and management

5. **Job Search Interface**
   - Search query builder with filters
   - Results display with quick-action buttons
   - Save and track functionality

## Integration Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **Resume Upload Flow**
   - File upload → Format conversion → Structure extraction → Database storage

2. **Job Scraping Flow**
   - URL input → Web scraping → Content extraction → Structure parsing → Database storage

3. **Analysis Flow**
   - Resume + Job selection → Comparison engine → Gap identification → Recommendation generation

4. **Optimization Flow**
   - Analysis results → AI rewrite engine → Structured suggestions → User review/edit

5. **Job Search Flow**
   - Search parameters → API query → Results filtering → Structured display

### External Integrations

1. **Document Processing**
   - PDF/DOCX parsing libraries
   - Text extraction and structure preservation

2. **Web Scraping**
   - Headless browser automation
   - HTML parsing and content extraction

3. **AI Services**
   - NLP for resume and job analysis
   - Text generation for resume optimization
   - Entity recognition for skill and requirement extraction

## Deployment Architecture

- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify for React application hosting
- Backend: Supabase for database, authentication, and serverless functions
- Storage: Supabase Storage for document files
- Scaling: Edge functions for performance-critical operations

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the MVP while establishing patterns that will support future enhancements and scale as the user base grows.
