# ResumeOptimizer Project Progress and Next Steps

## Progress Summary

The ResumeOptimizer application has made significant progress in establishing its foundation. Here's a detailed overview of what has been accomplished:

### 1. Environment Setup
- Created `.env` file with Supabase connection details
- Set up Supabase client in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- Defined database types in `shared/types/supabase.ts`

### 2. Database Schema
- Created SQL migrations for initial schema setup
- Implemented security policies for row-level security
- Established tables for users, resumes, jobs, analyses, and rewrites

### 3. Authentication System
- Implemented `AuthContext` for managing user authentication state
- Created login and registration pages with form validation
- Set up protected routes for authenticated content

### 4. UI Components
- **Layout Components**:
  - Header, Sidebar, and MainLayout for consistent navigation
- **Form Components**:
  - Input, TextArea, Select, Label, and FormGroup
- **Feedback Components**:
  - Toast, Modal, Loader, Progress, and Badge
- **Content Components**:
  - Button, Card, FileUpload, Tabs, and Avatar

### 5. API Services
- **Authentication Service** (`auth.service.ts`):
  - User sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out functionality
  - Session management and user profile updates
  - Password reset functionality
- **Resume Management Service** (`resume.service.ts`):
  - Resume creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
  - Resume file upload and storage management
  - Resume versioning and content parsing
- **Job Description Service** (`job.service.ts`):
  - Job posting creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
  - Job URL scraping (placeholder implementation)
  - Job description parsing (placeholder implementation)
- **Analysis Service** (`analysis.service.ts`):
  - Resume-to-job comparison analysis
  - Rewrite suggestions for resume sections
  - AI-powered analysis and optimization (placeholder implementations)

## Next Steps

The following steps are recommended to continue development of the ResumeOptimizer application:

### 1. Implement Document Upload Functionality
- **Resume Upload Component**:
  - Integrate the FileUpload component with the resume service
  - Implement file validation and error handling
  - Create a user-friendly upload experience
- **Document Parsing**:
  - Implement PDF parsing using pdf.js
  - Implement DOCX parsing using docx-parser
  - Extract structured content from uploaded documents
- **Resume Viewer**:
  - Create a component to display parsed resume content
  - Implement section highlighting and editing

### 2. Develop Dashboard Pages
- **Resume Management Page**:
  - List view of user's resumes
  - Detail view with version history
  - Edit and delete functionality
- **Job Description Management Page**:
  - Form for manual job entry
  - URL scraping integration
  - List view of saved jobs
- **Analysis Results Page**:
  - Comparison visualization between resume and job
  - Keyword matching display
  - Section-by-section analysis
  - Rewrite suggestions interface

### 3. Integrate AI Services
- **OpenAI Integration**:
  - Set up API client for GPT-4o
  - Implement prompt engineering for resume analysis
  - Create fallback to Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- **Document Analysis Logic**:
  - Implement keyword extraction and matching
  - Create skills gap identification
  - Develop ATS compatibility checking
- **Resume Optimization Workflow**:
  - Generate section-specific rewrite suggestions
  - Implement acceptance/rejection of suggestions
  - Create optimized resume version generation

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Set up Vitest for unit testing
- Implement React Testing Library for component tests
- Create end-to-end tests with Cypress
- Implement form validation with Zod or Yup

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Configure Vercel deployment
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Create production-ready build process

## Technical Considerations

- **State Management**: Consider implementing a more robust state management solution like React Query for data fetching and caching.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading for larger components.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test and optimize all pages for mobile devices.
- **Error Handling**: Implement a global error boundary and consistent error handling patterns.

## Dependencies to Add

- **Document Parsing**: `pdf.js`, `pdf-parse`, `docx-parser`
- **Web Scraping**: `puppeteer`, `cheerio`
- **Testing**: `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `cypress`
- **Form Validation**: `zod` or `yup`
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI and Anthropic client libraries

This document serves as a roadmap for continuing development of the ResumeOptimizer application. The foundation has been established, and the next steps focus on implementing core functionality, integrating AI services, and preparing for production deployment.
