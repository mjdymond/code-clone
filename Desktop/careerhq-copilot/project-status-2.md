*Last Updated: April 1, 2025*

## Project Overview

The CareerHQ CopilotKit UI Integration project creates a modern, agent-native frontend application that provides unprecedented transparency and human-in-the-loop control over AI agent workflows for career assistance. This application transforms the traditional chatbot experience into a collaborative workspace where users can see agent thinking, provide guidance at critical decision points, and maintain control throughout the career optimization process.

## Current Status

The project has made significant progress with the implementation of core components, debugging tools, and enhanced testing utilities. We've recently resolved several critical issues with the application's error handling and connection management systems. The API integration has been improved with proper URL path configuration, and we've implemented robust fallback mechanisms for offline or development mode usage.

The most notable recent improvements include:

1. **Enhanced Connection Resilience**: We've implemented a sophisticated fallback system that automatically switches to polling or mock data when SSE connections fail.

2. **Improved Error Handling**: We've added comprehensive error boundaries and component-level error handling to ensure the application remains usable even when parts of it encounter issues.

3. **Development Workflow Enhancements**: We've created a dedicated debug page and testing tools that allow developers to simulate complete agent workflows without requiring the backend.

4. **Component Compilation Fixes**: We've resolved several issues with component compilation, including properly marking client components with 'use client' directives and fixing import paths.

## Conclusion

The CareerHQ CopilotKit UI Integration project has made substantial progress with all core components now implemented and enhanced with robust debugging and testing tools. Our recent focus on error handling and connection resilience has significantly improved the application's stability and user experience.

The improvements to the SSE connection system, including fallback mechanisms for polling or mock data, ensure the application remains functional even when network connections are unstable. The enhanced error handling with proper client component marking and error boundaries prevents cascading failures and provides clear feedback to users when issues occur.

The debugging tools we've implemented, including the DebugPanel, ConnectionStatus indicator, and comprehensive WorkflowTester, make it much easier for developers to understand the application's behavior and troubleshoot issues. The ability to simulate complete agent workflows without requiring the backend is particularly valuable for iterative development and testing.

With these recent enhancements, the application is now much more robust and developer-friendly. Our focus now shifts to finalizing the testing with real data, implementing session persistence for a better user experience, and preparing for integration with the real backend.

The project remains on track to deliver a sophisticated agent-native interface that provides unprecedented transparency and human-in-the-loop control over AI agent workflows for career assistance.
